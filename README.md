# Advanced CSS Homework

For this assignment, I created a responsive portfolio project with the following parameters:


- Web page featuring:
    - Developer's name
    - Recent photo 
    - Navigation links, allowing the UI to jump to the following sections: 
        - about me
        - work
        - contact me
    - Sample a potential employee's previous work, including a link to the deployed site.
    - Previous work sample application image is larger than the four other images below it.
    - Media queries allowing for a responsive layout to accommadate for viewport sizes (desktop & mobile).
